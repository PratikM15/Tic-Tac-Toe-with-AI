# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-AI
Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Letâ€™s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing! After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using classes and functions, handling errors, and processing user input. You will also learn to use OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in the process.

Objectives
Your tasks for this stage:

Write a menu loop, which can interpret two commands: "start" and "exit".
Implement the command "start" , which should take two parameters: who will play X and who will play O. Two parameters are possible for now: "user" to play as a human and "easy" to play as an easy level AI.
The command "exit" should simply terminate the program.
In the next steps, you will add "medium" and "hard" parameters.

Do not forget to handle incorrect input! Print "Bad parameters" if something is wrong.
